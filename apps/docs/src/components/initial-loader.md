# `<ReactListInitialLoader>`

This component is for the very first load — when the list has not yet received any data. This is useful to show a skeleton loader or shimmer when the user first visits the page.

```jsx
<ReactList>
  <ReactListInitialLoader>
    <!-- Render your skeleton/shimmer here -->
  </ReactListInitialLoader>
</ReactList>
```
